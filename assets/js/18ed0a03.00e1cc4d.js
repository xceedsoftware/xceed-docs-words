Tar is an archiver: it gathers a collection of files or folders into a single file, while preserving file system information (such as permissions, dates and the directory structure); however, it does not compress the files in any way. The GZip format on the other hand is typically used to compress single files (although it is possible for a GZip archive to contain multiple files; see ",(0,s.jsx)(i.a,{href:"/zip/basic-concepts/tar-gzip-capabilities/gzip/performing-multifile-gzip",children:"Multi-file operations"})," for details)."]}),"\n",(0,s.jsx)(i.p,{children:"Using these two formats together\u2014using Tar to create an archive and then compressing it with GZip\u2014can potentially attain greater compression ratios than using a compressing archiver such as ZIP. The ZIP format compresses the individual files and then archives them into a single .zip file. With a GZipped Tar file, files are first archived into a .tar file and then the whole archive is compressed. The advantage here is that the compression engine searches for similar patterns across the entire archive, rather than just within each individual file, thereby increasing the chances of finding these patterns, the basis of this kind of compression.
